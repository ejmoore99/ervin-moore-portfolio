              <p>
Participating in the Red Hat B.U.I.L.D. program has been an incredibly enriching experience. From
 the insights to the invaluable guidance from experienced mentors, I have deepened my knowledge and 
 skills on various topics that have significantly contributed to my professional development. In this
  journal, I will share my journey, the highlights of the program, and the key takeaways that have shaped
   my career aspirations.

                <h3>Meeting 1: Introduction to the Red Hat B.U.I.L.D. Program</h3>    
                <h4>Thursday Apr 11, 2024</h4>
<p>The first meeting with the Red Hat B.U.I.L.D. program was a virtual Google meet meeting.
In this meeting, we introduced ourselves to each other, went over the objective for this program, and desired
 outcomes of the program via a powerpoint presentation. I had already knew about two or three mentors from the program because
  I had went tothe Red Hat Intern Open-House (where l also found out about the B.U.I.L.D. program opportunity.) At the end they
revealed Mentors and Mentees that were paired together for the 6 month journey. I had the pleasure of being paired 
to Vishali, who is a  Software Quality Engineer at the Red Hat. Vishali reached out to me via Linkedin within the week of the
 initial meeting to schedule our first one-on-one meeting.</p>
                <h3>Meeting 2: First One-on-one Meeting w/ my Mentor</h3>    
                <h4>Friday Apr 26, 2024</h4>
<p>For our first one on one meeting, Vishali set up a meeting at Barnes & Noble’s. When I arrived, we introduced ourselves, and
	 she asked me if I want anything to drink and and we went from there. She wanted to touch base with where I was in my
	  software development journey and I told her I had worked on a couple of projects on my own and had some relevant
	   coursework at Wake Tech. From there she asked me if I had any questions and I asked her a couple of questions
	    about suggestions for projects I should implement and what are some things I should work on that would enhance
		 my journey. She gave me a couple of resources on programming languages and also gave me some recommendations
		  for my LinkedIn, which all were very useful going forward in my journey.
</p>

<p>
After my meeting with Vishali, I decided to further enhance my skills on JavaScript and React through some of the resources
she suggested. One of the key takeaways from the meeting was to not just learn, but to also implement what you’re learning.
 I took it upon myself to build a real estate react web app, using the knowledge from her resources. It was my first react 
 project so naturally I ran into some problems, but anytime I asked her for help with my code she would review it and send
  me feedback along with a solution. Overall, at this point I was excited about the program and liked the direction things
   were going in. Then she set a meeting for Wednesday 05/22.
</p>

                <h3>Meeting 3: </h3>    
                <h4>Wednesday  May 22, 2024</h4>
<p>This meeting was set through Google meets like the initial program meeting was. In this meeting, it was probably one of the
	 more informative meetings that I had.  She went over a lot of concepts that I had never heard of
Such as testing (unit, component, and integration testing) using Cypress, she also mentioned open source contributions
 and gave me a project to work on. She suggested a meme generator, but for some reason, a fortune cookie generator was set
  in my mind. She also recommended I deepen my knowledge on react functions like hooks (such as useState).</p>

<p>After the meeting, I decided to look into the topics we had discussed starting with Cypress testing. I developed a 
understanding of Cypress and some of it’s many features. Then I did research on how to contribute to open-source repositories
 on GitHub, like how to fork a repository, create a different branch, make edits to code, merge branches, and make a pull
  request. Then I developed a basic JavaScript app, the fortune cookie generator. I sent Vishali a few projects. I worked
   on since our last meeting, including the fortune cookie generator, and she gave feedback on my projects and progress.</p>

During this time, a Red Hat B.U.I.L.D. Mid-Point sync up meeting was scheduled.</p>

                <h3>Meeting 4: </h3>    
                <h4> Thursday June 20, 2024</h4>
<p>This meeting was very simple and straightforward. It was a meeting to track progress and touch base with where everyone was
	 at, and shared our experiences with the program so far. They also asked if we had any suggestions on things that we would
	  like to implement in the program. Suggestions for a interview prep were made. They also mentioned that there will be a
	   résumé workshop coming up this year. Overall, it was positive feedback from both mentors and mentees. Me and Vishali
	    set up another meeting via Google meets for the following week.
